Instructions:
Run main.ipynb as-is, except you will need to get the same images as me.
You can do that by finding them in https://github.com/ri-nath/cs180/tree/main/proj2/data.
Just copy the data/ folder over.
When prompted to align images, align by the eyes.
For minas tirith; good luck, it was hard to align, my tip is to align via the mountain and part of the city.
